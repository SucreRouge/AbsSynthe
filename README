AbsSynthe - a tool to synthesize controllers from succinct safety
specifications. 

This is the second version of AbsSynthe. I have now included scripts to profile the code and
to run it (profile.sh and start.sh). The -nd option explicitely tells the tool to avoid
using the compositional optimizations that have been included. Also, the -s option tells
the tool to use a symblicit forward algorithm instead of our very successful backward
fixpoint algorithm (a.k.a. Romain's algo).

The idea of a "game" has been abstracted and subclasses of the Game class in the algos.py
script should be used to be able to reuse the code in algos.py.
