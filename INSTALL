In order to run AbsSynthe you need to make sure you have installed both

1) swig (http://www.swig.org/), and
2) pycudd (http://bears.ece.ucsb.edu/pycudd.html).

You might need to install your Python version headers.

In the directory containing this file you should have a subdirectory called
aiger_swig. There you will find a simple AIGER reader provided by the Johannes
Kepler University (see http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/) slightly modied for the
Synthesis Competition - SyntComp (modified version available at
https://syntcompdb.iaik.tugraz.at/). In the same directory you will find a swig
wrapper for the AIGER reader and a makefile to compile it. You should make.

You will probably have to add to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH cudd for pycudd to work.
Pycudd itself along with the wrapped AIGER reader can also be added to
PYTHONPATH for simplicity.

Finally, run "python synth.py -h" to see the available options for the AbsSynthe
tool.
